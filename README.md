## Rob One Inventory

This is a very small simple mod.
Any filter option you select during open inventory will stay next time you open your inventory.
So for example if you filter on "weapon", if you close and open inventory, this filter presists.

This can be useful to avoid rummage through your inventory looking for that trap or potion.
Just select consumable/deployable. Go near enemy and open inventory again.

#### Compatibility
Should be fully compatible with anything modifying the inventory.
Should work fine with [BetterInventory](https://outward.thunderstore.io/package/Faeryn/BetterInventory/)
